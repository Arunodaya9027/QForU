QForU is a software tool designed to assist students in preparing for coding interviews
and placements by providing a user-friendly platform to practice solving industry-ready coding
problems. The tool extracts coding problems, along with their examples and basic test cases,
from various coding platforms. These problems are displayed on the QForU website with a
normal CSS style, making it easy for students to access and practice.

The project aims to develop a software tool called QForU, a centralized platform for
students to practice coding problems from various coding platforms. QForU will extract coding
problems, examples, and basic test cases from different sources and present them through a
user-friendly website. This technical documentation provides an overview of the features,
architecture, and technologies used.
